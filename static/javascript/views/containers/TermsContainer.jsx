                Our Product does not contain any links to third-party web sites or services that are not owned or controlled
                by Mayank Sindwani. In the event that third-party links were to be included, Mayank Sindwani has no control over,
                and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party web sites or

                on any such content, goods or services available on or through any such web sites or services. We strongly advise
                you to read the terms and conditions and privacy policies of any third-party web sites or services that you visit.

            <h2>TERMINATION</h2>
            <p>
                We may terminate or suspend the support or access to our Product/Service immediately, without prior notice or liability,
                for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms. All provisions of the Terms
                which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation,
                ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.

            <h2>DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES; LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h2>

                We do not guarantee, represent or warrant that your use of our Product/Service will be uninterrupted, timely,
                secure or error-free. We do not warrant that the results that may be obtained from the use of the Product will
                be accurate or reliable. You agree that from time to time we may remove the Product for indefinite periods of time
                or suspend the Service without notice to you.
            </p>
            <p>
                You expressly agree that your use of, or inability to use, the Product/Service is at your sole risk.
                The Service and all products and services delivered to you through the Service are (except as expressly stated by
                us) provided 'as is' and 'as available' for your use, without any representation, warranties or conditions of
                any kind, either express or implied, including all implied warranties or conditions of merchantability,
                merchantable quality, fitness for a particular purpose, durability, title, and non-infringement.
            </p>
            <p>
                In no case shall Mayank Sindwani be liable for any injury, loss, claim, or any direct, indirect, incidental,
                punitive, special, or consequential damages of any kind, including, without limitation lost profits, lost revenue,
                lost savings, loss of data, replacement costs, or any similar damages, whether based in contract, tort
                (including negligence), strict liability or otherwise, arising from your use of any of the service or any products
                procured using the service, or for any other claim related in any way to your use of the service or any product,
                including, but not limited to, any errors or omissions in any content, or any loss or damage of any kind incurred

                via the service, even if advised of their possibility. Because some states or jurisdictions do not allow the
                exclusion or the limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in such states or jurisdictions,
                our liability shall be limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.
